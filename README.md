### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Momchil, and I have been involved in front-end development for 2 years and my interests are to improve my knowledge. I have completed some courses at the SoftUni academy (Java Script-basic, Java Script-fundamentals, Java Script-Advanced). I have also been attending specialized private lessons for front-end development (HTML, CSS, Java Script) at https://azprogramiram.bg for a year. I can work in a team and I am responsible, fair and loyal.
